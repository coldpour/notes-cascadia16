* [CSS Day](#css-day)
* [Browser Day](#browser-day)
* [Node Day](#node-day)

Here are my tl;drs for the talks that I saw last week at [CascadiaFest](http://2016.cascadiafest.org). Videos of all the talks will be posted to the [CascadiaJS YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/cascadiajs/playlists) in a few days.

Check out the [#cascadia16](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cascadia16?src=hash) hastag on Twitter. Also, [@floriidaaa](https://twitter.com/@floriidaaa) tweeted her sketchnotes from many of the talks which sum up the slides in a single page. 

## CSS Day

### Natalya Shelburne - Practical color theory for people who code

Creating a color pallete is not magic, it's science and here's the [formula](http://tallys.github.io/color-theory/).

### Justin McDowell - Bauhaus in the Browser

Bauhaus was a German collective that pushed the envelope of typography and graphic design. We are just now starting to be able to replicate their designs in CSS.

### Miriam Suzanne - Code Patterns for Pattern-Making

Good patterns combine languages in ways that add meaning to your code by relating elements with common purpose. Get on the same page with your naming conventions. Abstract in layers.

### Mike Kivikoski - CSS Pseudo – :hover, ::after and beyond

Pseudo selectors are like regular expressions. They are amazingly powerful and flexible. Please wield with an eye toward maintainability and common understanding on your team.

### Clarissa Peterson - Creating Beautiful, Accessible, and User-Friendly Forms

Form elements ask questions of your users. Whittle down to the bare minimum number of questions you need to ask. Put directions at the top. Then make sure it still works in a screen reader. Oh and not everyone understands what red asterisks mean.

### Stephanie Hobson - Flipping Tables: Displaying Data on Small Screens

Using a table for layout (lists, columns, etc...) is like crack. Don't do it, not even once. Tables are for displaying data that can be sorted, compared, cross-referenced, and calculated. If you're not going to allow sorting in your mobile browser, don't use a table to display the data. Make a card that contains the data for each entry that fits nicely on the screen or a graph to visualize the data.

### Alice Bartlett - “Can't you just make it more like Bootstrap” | Considerations for creating a component system

We wrote a component library called [Origami](http://origami.ft.com/) to unify the look and feel of the ~100 sites that make up the Financial Times online presense. It's not only a technical process, it's also political. People won't fight you, they'll just ignore you unless you can force the issue. 

### James Steinbach - Using Sass & PostCSS Together

Sass and PostCSS are both preprocessors that do certain things really well. Use them for their individual strengths.

[Slides](https://jdsteinbach.com/sass-postcss/#/)

### Tyler Sticka - SVG: So Very Good

Most image formats express images in a bitmap of pixels. SVG expresses images in xml which is parseable and codeable by both humans and machines. The files are smaller and the rendered images are always higher fidelity on any screen size. Animate them to create native feeling apps in the browser.

### Lourdes Montano - Learning and feeling overwhelmed: methods to organize your learning process in CSS

Programming is hard, staying current is hard, getting discouraged is easy. Learn new things only when they seem relevant. Look back at your old code to see how you've changed. Respect your own learning pace. View messy projects as a learning opportunity.

[Slides](https://es.slideshare.net/secret/sM6tGE1TkBSzVo)

### Gregor Martynus - Welcoming Communities

Building a community around your open source project takes more work and different skills than just writing and publishing the code. Don't treat people like code. Be generous when you interpret what people say. Say, "thank you" when people contribute. Respond quickly and tell people that it will take time to review and give them a thorough response. It's easier to contribute to projects that are broken up into small modules with good documentation.

### Alan Stearns - Becoming Responsible for CSS

Browsers are evolving to support the features you want. CSS, HTML, and JS standards writers want input from developers, their users. Submit browser bugs. Do it.
